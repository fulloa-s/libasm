# libasm

An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming
language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong
(but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture’s
machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer
architecture. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable
across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language
may also be called symbolic machine code.

You must rewrite the following functions in asm:
◦ ft_strlen (man 3 strlen)
◦ ft_strcpy (man 3 strcpy)
◦ ft_strcmp (man 3 strcmp)
◦ ft_write (man 2 write)
◦ ft_read (man 2 read)
◦ ft_strdup (man 3 strdup, you can call to malloc)

• You must write 64 bits ASM. Beware of the "calling convention".
• You can’t do inline ASM, you must do ’.s’ files.
• You must compile your assembly code with nasm.
• You must use the Intel syntax, not the AT&T
